# Vector Math Benchmark

This project benchmarks several open source vector math libraries against one another to establish a baseline for performance.  Currently, it only tests GLM, DirectXMath, and SimpleMath from DirectXTK.

Note that this repository was created with `cmake-init`, and much of what is here is boilerplate related to it.  The only really important thing in the repository is `src/main.cpp`, which includes all of the benchmarking code.
